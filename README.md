## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Js

### What I learned

I learnt about responsiveness; how to make a site look good on a wide range of screens from desktop to mobile, also learnt how to use position absolute to position elements, div on any part of a website.

I learnt css animations and used it to ass a pulsing effect to the CTO at the bottom of the screen, also learnt about javascript DOM Manipulation and used it to add a hover animation to the "feature blocks".

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.main-4 {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: 50%;
    height: 300px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 15px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 8px -4px hsl(208, 11%, 55%);
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 425px;
    right: 25%;
    z-index: 10;
    background: white;
}
```
```js

```
